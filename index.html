            </h3>
            <p id="someText">Neo (born as Thomas A. Anderson, also known as The One, an anagram for Neo) is a fictional character and the protagonist of The Matrix franchise, created by the Wachowskis. He was portrayed as a cybercriminal and computer programmer by Keanu Reeves in the films, as well as having a cameo in The Animatrix short film Kid's Story. Andrew Bowen provided Neo's voice in The Matrix: Path of Neo.[1] In 2021, Reeves reprised his role in The Matrix Resurrections[2] with what Vulture calls "his signature John Wick look".[3]

                In 2008, Neo was selected by Empire as the 68th Greatest Movie Character of All Time...[1] Neo is also an anagram of "one", a reference to his destiny of being The One who would bring peace.[4] There are claims that a nightclub in Chicago inspired the name of the character.[5][6] Neo is considered to be a superhero.
